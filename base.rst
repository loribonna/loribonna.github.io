Currently AI Engineer at `Symboolic <https://www.symboolic.com>`_, previously Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia.

My Ph.D. at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia focused on various fields, including learning from a continuous stream of data, learning from noisy data, satellite and remote-sensing analysis, anomaly detection, self-supervised learning, and model merging. A significant focus of my work involves devising novel strategies to address catastrophic forgetting in computer vision and classification tasks. 

I'm also a tinkerer with a passion for software development. I'm proficient in **Python** (*PyTorch*, *matplotlib*, *pandas*, *FastAPI*, *SQL Alchemy*), have some basic experience with Full Stack Development with **TypeScript/JavaScript** (:abbr:`older versions (pre-2020)` of *React*, *Angular*, *Vue.js*), and the usual suspects (*LaTex*, *Git*, *Docker*).
