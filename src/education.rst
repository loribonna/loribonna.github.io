During the Ph.D., I focused on core problems in Continual Learning, such as training under complex and constrained scenarios. The overall goal was to develop techniques that can be applied to more realistic scenarios, such as those involving unreliable annotations (missing, biased, or noisy), streaming data that limits multiple epochs, privacy concerns that prevent the use of rehearsal strategies, and the use of modern pretrained Transformer-based architectures. 

Besides this more theoretical research, I also worked on case studies that involve the analysis of satellite and remote-sensing data to forecast the presence and spread of zoonotic diseases (e.g., West Nile Virus).

Thesis
~~~~~~
.. _msc-thesis:

This study aims to assess the impact of limited labels in Continual Learning, while also examining the effectiveness of common methods in a semi-supervised environment. The motivation for this work stems from the fact that promising techniques in Continual Learning typically rely on fully annotated datasets (supervised training). However, providing such information for every example is costly and time-consuming, as it requires significant human labor. 

The results of this study were published in the paper :ref:`Continual semi-supervised learning through contrastive interpolation consistency <paper-ccic>` in the Pattern Recognition Letters journal.

Project activities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During both my bachelor's and master's degree courses, I carried out several project activities:

- Computer Vision system recognizing, rectifying, and retrieving images of paintings in the Estense Gallery of Modena. The system was developed for the "Computer Vision and Cognitive Systems" course and utilizes :bdg-primary-line:`OpenCV` and :bdg-primary-line:`scikit-learn` libraries. In addition, the system uses :bdg-primary-line:`YOLOv3` to recognize the position of gallery visitors from the provided images.

- Missile defense system simulation: Simulating a set of Patriot defense missiles that identify enemy targets and predict their trajectory to hit them. The application was developed for the "Real-time embedded systems" course in :bdg-primary-line:`C` language and the :bdg-primary-line:`pthreads` library for managing concurrency between different execution units.

- Kittenwars: An application that sorts images based on a voting mechanism by users, developed for the "Web and Mobile Applications" course. The system includes a backend developed using the :bdg-primary-line:`NestJS` framework, a mobile app developed using :bdg-primary-line:`React Native`, and a web interface developed using :bdg-primary-line:`React`. Through the web interface, administrators have advanced functionalities for deleting and managing votes.

- Car-sharing application: A mediation application between drivers and customers in a car-sharing context, developed for the "Dynamic Languages" course. The system allows customers to select start and end points on a map and view a list of their reservations, while drivers can view active reservations and modify their rates. An Administrator user type is also provided, which can manage refund requests and add/remove users from the blacklist. For the technical aspect, the backend of the application was developed using the :bdg-primary-line:`Django` framework and is available for installation via :bdg-primary-line:`Docker`, while :bdg-primary-line:`Vue.js` was chosen for managing the user interface on the front end.

- Bit Heroes: A 2D video game inspired by Dungeon and Dragons, developed for the "Object-Oriented Programming" course. The project involves development in the :bdg-primary-line:`Java` language, with animation and event management handled using the :bdg-primary-line:`LibGDX` library.
